WEBSITE SCRAPING TO ANALYZE MULTI LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP FORMAT.
--
In this small project, a web scraping is carried out to analyze the 
national women's soccer league as a whole (third division in the 21/22 
season) divided into 7 groups distributed throughout the national territory. 
A general classification determined by the points per game is made, and the 
best and worst teams are studied according to different metrics. 
The teams that promote to a higher category or descend to a lower one are 
also detailed. In addition, the top scorers in the category are included.
